# OneFileLinux Documentation Update Tasks

## Documentation Updates Completed

1. **Feature Flag System Documentation**
   - [x] Document `parse_build_flags()` function and its role in the build system
   - [x] Create comprehensive table of all feature flags with descriptions and default values
   - [x] Document relationships between high-level flags (--minimal, --full) and individual feature flags
   - [x] Explain how feature flags affect package selection, kernel configuration, and build output
   - [x] Include examples of common flag combinations

2. **Kernel Configuration System Updates**
   - [x] Document the overlay-based kernel configuration system
   - [x] Explain the role of base configs (minimal.config, standard.config)
   - [x] Document feature-specific overlays and how they're conditionally applied
   - [x] Update information about kernel minimization process
   - [x] Document kernel config directory structure and organization

3. **Build Environment Documentation**
   - [x] Document environment detection mechanisms (is_github_actions, is_docker_container)
   - [x] Explain environment-specific adaptations in the build system
   - [x] Document permission handling across different environments
   - [x] Explain resource optimization mechanisms (memory, threads)
   - [x] Document troubleshooting approaches for different environments

4. **CI/CD Documentation**
   - [x] Document GitHub Actions workflow structure
   - [x] Explain the build matrix for different configurations
   - [x] Document artifact generation and distribution
   - [x] Explain Docker integration in GitHub Actions
   - [x] Document release process

5. **Architecture Documentation Updates**
   - [x] Update library architecture documentation to include new functions
   - [x] Document build flag propagation through the build process
   - [x] Update build sequence documentation to reflect current implementation
   - [x] Document special handling for minimal builds

## Implementation Completed

1. **Research Phase**
   - [x] Review all shell scripts to identify undocumented features
   - [x] Catalog all feature flags and their effects
   - [x] Document kernel configuration overlay system

2. **Draft Phase**
   - [x] Create draft documentation sections
   - [x] Generate feature flag reference table
   - [x] Document kernel configuration overlay system

3. **Review and Update**
   - [x] Review documentation for accuracy and completeness
   - [x] Add all new documentation to USER_GUIDE.md Developer Documentation section
   - [x] Emphasize the single-file EFI nature and Docker as the recommended build approach

4. **Documentation Consolidation**
   - [x] Consolidated all documentation into the USER_GUIDE.md instead of separate files
   - [x] Added Developer Documentation section to USER_GUIDE.md
   - [x] Emphasized the importance of small image size and single-file EFI nature
   - [x] Highlighted Docker as the recommended cross-platform build method

## Future Documentation Improvements

1. **Enhanced Visual Documentation**
   - [ ] Add diagrams showing the build process flow
   - [ ] Create visual representations of the feature flag relationships
   - [ ] Add screenshots of the build process and output

2. **Advanced Developer Tutorials**
   - [ ] Create a step-by-step guide for adding new packages
   - [ ] Document the process for adding new hardware support
   - [ ] Create examples of common development tasks

3. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - [ ] Document build time comparisons across different environments
   - [ ] Create size impact analysis for different feature flags
   - [ ] Benchmark boot times on different hardware

_The documentation now properly reflects the sophisticated architecture of OneFileLinux, with emphasis on its core features as a small single-file EFI executable and the Docker-based cross-platform build approach._
